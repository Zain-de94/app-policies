Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 24/02/2025
Background Video Recorder ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.
1. Permissions We Request
To function properly, our app requires the following permissions:
Camera & Microphone: Required to record video and audio. This may occur in the background (while other apps are open or the screen is off) only when initiated by the user for security or dashcam purposes.
Storage: To save recorded videos locally on your device.
Internet: Used for Google Drive backups and displaying advertisements.
2. Third-Party Services & Data Collection
We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.
Google AdMob: We display advertisements provided by Google AdMob. This service may collect Device Identifiers (such as your Advertising ID) and usage data to show personalized ads.
Google Drive (Optional): You may choose to link your Google account to back up your videos. If you enable this, the app uses the Google Drive API to upload files to your personal Google Drive account. We do not have access to your login credentials or any other files in your Drive.
3. Data Security
Local Storage: By default, all videos are stored locally on your device.
Cloud Storage: No videos are uploaded to any server unless you explicitly enable the "Auto Backup" feature to your own private Google Drive.
We do not have access to your recordings, and we do not share them with third parties.
